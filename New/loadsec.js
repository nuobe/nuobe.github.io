<em>Air</em> imagines a speculative world where planetary-scale computation acts like a natural system. In this world, Air is a smart home device that uses the aerial particle system to help people understand data flow in their quantified surroundings which is impossible to sense or recognize. This work is an online user manual leading to a VR video that depicts three mornings of a person waking up to interact with Air. In this video, time, body, data and intelligence are overlapped and displaced.

        As artificial superintelligence progresses, multiple superintelligences co-evolve 
        into a supernature. We are now under the influence of two natural systems. While 
        we already have forecasting systems for disasters in nature, how can we forecast 
        catastrophes that happen in supernature, as they are formed with the corresponding data 
        structures of everyone and everything?
        <br>
        <br>
        AIR is here to help!
        <br>
        <br>
        AIR reads the atmosphere in supernature. The forces of supernature are hard to track 
        as they extend beyond the 3 dimensions we live in. Now we have AIR who can forecast 
        and translate supernature events into atmospheric phenomena we can understand. It also 
        gives advice on how to deal with data gales, storms and hurricanes.

<h1>Water</h1>
<p>
<em>Water</em> is an imaginary data structure for people to store, share, and delete their data. Inspired by the history and practice of water memory, this work imagines an unstable data structure as an alternative to the stable stacks of computer memory and its clear interface of data interaction. Moving away from the networks of massive data collection and analysis, Water speculates the life cycles of data within the cycles of water transformations among solid, liquid, and gas. By introducing ambiguous mechanism and interface, Water empowers one’s relationship with their own data.

<h1>Fire</h1>
<p>
<strong><em>Fire</em></strong> is a GPU kit that exists outside of computers.<br>
<strong><em>Fire</em></strong> is NOT energy efficient and only runs ONCE.<br>
<br>
In a situation where mineral and chemical based GPUs run out, <em>Fire</em> as a wood based GPU is the only type available for AI training. <em>Fire</em> GPU kit is made out of 4 panels of wooden equilateral triangles with etchings of machine learning scripts and data inputs. With <em>Fire</em>, the process of training AI via heating up GPU chips becomes a visceral experience of burning data and computer programs on wood.
<br><br>
<em>Fire</em> imagines a hard limit on the powerful technology involved with GPU. Unlike a mineral and chemical based GPU that can run a million iterations over thousands of data inputs for AI to learn, <strong>ONE</strong> <em>Fire</em> GPU kit can only run <strong>ONE</strong> iteration of training with a limited number of data specified. The amount of data that can be learned by AI corresponds to the size of the wood to be burned and thus the harm it will do to the environment. <em>Fire</em> provides a situation where the data put into AI and the purpose of training it should be carefully considered.

    Pigxell is a combination of performance and a computer game, where the performer plays as an 
    NPC in the game. This game is, as many other room-decorating games, all about personalization. 
    However, here, gaining control of a virtual personal space means giving up certain controls of 
    one’s image.
    <br><br>
    A character in the game, a pig, trades furniture with the player only if they trade images of 
    their body; eyes, nose, ears, mouth, hands, feet. Accordingly the furniture pieces players 
    purchased from the pig have labels of the pig’s eye, snout, mouth, ear, etc. The pig manages 
    the shop in game while the performer manages the pig. The performer manually checks images sent 
    from players, and then uses them as materials for making posters. The performer re-arranges their 
    own apartment space, bringing the aesthetic and images from the game into their room, and shoots 
    photos for making the posters.

    " &nbsp;&nbsp;Pigxell makes and trades furniture. Every staff at 
    Pigxell dedicates to make your space a place. With a 
    selection of furniture that incorporates our unique 
    aesthetic, you can personalize your room with ease. 
    The creation of space is central to us. It is shown in a
    story shared in Pigxell. Michael Townsend, who lives in 
    Rhode Island, found a secret space behind two walls in 
    the construction site of Providence Place Mall. The two 
    walls almost touched but left a gap for entrance. Since
    then, Townsend started to decorate the space, making it 
    his second home, but from outside people can only see 
    the two solid facades. We hide behind the veneer
    facade of images and uniform aesthetics. We own and re-
    plenish the place in the gap between personal control 
    and image flow. At Pigxell, everyone embraces the idea of
    play. We dedicate to host your play, while you may also 
    find us as players and actors beyond your gaze. 
    <br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, we invite you to the game. "

    Our digital bodies and profiles, whether they are represented as digital spaces, blogs, social media 
    posts, are created in the process of compromisation; it is the compromise between the users who wants 
    to personalize their digital profiles and the system that is always trying to make a “personalized”  
    digital body not personal at all. Does the person working on and for the digital system also 
    encounter some sorts of compromise? In the case of my performance, I produced posters and 
    ads for the game not only using images from the players but also my own personal space --- a physical apartment 
    space where I live. While the compromise on the player side happens when they gave images of their 
    body parts to the game in trade of decorations for their digital space, the compromise on my end 
    happens when I decorate my room to be not “my room”, as I tried to match the lighting and furniture 
    to look like those in the game.
